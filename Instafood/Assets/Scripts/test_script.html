A blaring alarm goes off, as you start to recollect your surroundings.

You take a peak at your phone.

It’s 9 AM

Part of you just wants to stay in bed, and think about things. Think about life. A time to recollect.

But time is a luxury not afforded to people like me.

<color=yellow><b>Optimist:</b></color> A brand new day! Rise and grind babyyyy

<color=grey><b>Anarchist:</b></color> Yet another day as a wage slave.

<color=maroon><b>Leninist:</b></color> Alright! Time to make your boss richer.

<color=cyan><b>Social-Democrat:</b></color> Well you won’t get anything done sitting in bed!

You grab your phone and look at your current order requests.
